        <p class = "par1">
               Flamingos are one of the amazing birds with their unique characteristics which are similiar features to members of "FlaminGo Team". First of
            all, flamingos are rarely seen just by themselves. They usually live in, and move with large groups. As well as, our team members prefer to get valuable results
            by being union, working together, and helping one another. In addition, because of long legs, flamingos can cover long distances in
            just one step. It represents that our team members can get amazing results in short period of time. Finally, flamingos' beautiful appearance attract people and 
            make them happy. Similarly, our projects make a good impression on our audience, and present them fascinating view.<br>Another aspect of the name “Flamingo” is that it ends with a “GO”, GO is a powerful computing
            language developed at google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson. It is very similar to C,
            which is our programming language of instruction. It is heavily used in the programming of servers.

        <p class = "par2">
            The background-color of our logo is turquoise (a combination of blue, blue-green and green), which
            represents; wisdom, tranquility, protection, good fortune, and hope. On it, it has a block been 
            assembled. The individual blocks represents all the amount of knowledge and guidance we will get from
            our professors in ADA to form one complete and coherent block. After all, computer science is all about
            building blocks that are sturdy and adequately communicate with each other.
