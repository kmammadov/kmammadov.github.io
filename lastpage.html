                In its simplest form, Hour of Code is just an activity undertaken by a group to teach computer
programming to another group often kids to demystify the concept that only a specific group or caliber
of people can do computer programming, while making it as enjoyable as much as possible.<br><br>Every year at ADA, students from the SITE faculty are in charge of carrying out an hour of code project.
That is, teach youngsters the benefit and skills of programming. It is not intense and it usually runs for
approximately one hour. Our group, which consists of 4 members (Khaleed, Namiq, Fuad, and Noel) was
given such a task of teaching coding to young kids. So, let’s take a look at how we accomplished the task
or attempted to accomplish the task.<br><br>In order, to accomplish this task, we had to find a school located in Baku. On the first day, Khaleed and
Noel went to [school-lyceum complex No.200]. The response from the school authorities wasn’t straight
forward, they told us to come later the next week. When next week arrived, Khaleed, Fuad and Noel all
went to the school again to seek for permission but this time a more straight forward answer was given.
The school authorities said that the school was under quarantine and so we couldn’t undertake our
project there. Disappointed, Fuad offered to talk to his school. In fact, he spoke to his school the very
next day and he got the green light for the project. We were all happy to hear the good news but then
our happiness was cut short when he verified that Baku secondary school No.46 had already been
booked been book by another group [group 3]. Khaleed suggested that we write an email to our
professor, Araz muallim. The response from Araz muallim was negative. He clearly stated that no two
groups could undertake the same project in the same school even if it were in different grades. Khaleed
a gain suggested that he had another school in mind. But since it was not close to campus, he went
alone to the aforementioned school. This time, this particular school wanted a document from ADA
University either for verification reasons or confirmation. That didn’t work out and again Khaleed went
to another school called Zangilan (Karabakh) secondary no.29 and this time we were lucky. The school
accepted and gave us a definite date of 8th December at 9:30 am.<br><br>We had a school and now what was left was to complete our project. The various members of the
groups had different responsibilities:<br><br> <div class = "table1">

            <td>Write report</td>
          </tr>
      </table>

We all arrived on time at the campus, meet with the enthusiastic students and went on to have a fruitful
session with them. They definitely learned something new and some of them said they will like to be
programmers in the future. We also had some pictures and videos with them and at last our project was
completed.<br><br>The report was written and submitted on time. The project taught us some very useful lessons, such as; <br>- It is never early enough to start working on a project
<br>- Two brains are better than one<br>- Team work works<br>
- It is really difficult sticking to deadlines<br>
- How to deal with pressure from numerous assignments

            We started on November 24th and promised each other that we would finish the individual part by November 29th. Fortunately,
             we all kept our word and finished it on time. After that, we decided to divide our responsibilities. These responsibilities
              are to find the team's name, design the logo, and write paragraps about hour of code and  web site experience. When we were looking for
               the name of the team, Khalid
               proposed 5 names, and at the request of everyone, the name FlaminGo was chosen. After that, we started choosing a logo, and 
               then Noel Stephen offered 10 logos, and as a result of the group's decision, we choose one of them. After that, we moved on 
               to the main stage of preparing the site and shared our responsibilities here. Here, Khalid made cover and wrote a description of
                team name, Noel wrote description of logo, the group members all wrote a short paragraph about themselves and sent it to Khalid, and he encrypted it. 
               After that Namig wrote about the website. He wrote everything they did here to prepare the website and sent it to Khalid. Then,
                Noel Stephen wrote a paragraph about the hour of code and sent it to Khalid. After all of this information was sent to 
                Khalid, we all decided on the designs and colors together, and we wrote code. Finally, you can see our web page.
